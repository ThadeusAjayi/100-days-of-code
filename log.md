# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 13, 201r (Node.js and Express.js)

**Today's Progress**: Hosted an API on Cloud9 #FreeCodeCamp Node.js and Express.js .

**Thoughts**: I started a class on building rest APIs yesterday and was considering how I would host it, obviously my regular host need me to have a VPS and all that. With #FreeCodeCamp Node.js and Express.js I saw cloud9 and that was it *Boom*.

**Link(s) to work**:
