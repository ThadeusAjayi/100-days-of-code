# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 13, 2017 (Node.js and Express.js)

**Today's Progress**: Hosted an API on Cloud9 #FreeCodeCamp Node.js and Express.js .

**Thoughts**: I started a class on building rest APIs yesterday and was considering how I would host it, obviously my regular host need me to have a VPS and all that. With #FreeCodeCamp Node.js and Express.js I saw cloud9 and that was it *Boom*.

**Thoughts**: Reading files I always skipped, I now love it

### Day 3: October 15, 2017 (http Javascript)

**Today's Progress**: Playing around with http functions and async http

**Thoughts**: Async async async it is
